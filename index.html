            </h3>
            <p>WDD 130 Final Project.</p>
            <p>Basic use of HTML and CSS. This was my first solo website.</p>

            <h3>
                <a href="https://ashesmsmith.github.io/wdd230/chamber/" target="_blank">Rexburg Chamber of Commerce</a>

            <p>Chamber project for WDD 230.</p>
            <p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript and OpenWeather API.</p>
            <p>Project had to be based on a real city, use an API to display weather data, links had to be functional, and 
                all pages had to be responsive.</p>

            <h3>
                <a href="https://ashesmsmith.github.io/wdd230/final/index.html" target="_blank">Scoots - Original</a>

            <p>WDD 230 Final Project. Original Version.</p>
            <p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript and OpenWeather API.</p>
            <p>Information for company name, location, pricing, and rental agreement provided in assignment. I made the logo and 
                favicon, chose the colors, stock images, and made all other design choices.</p>

            <h3>

            <p>WDD 230 Final Project. Final Version.</p>
            <p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript and OpenWeather API.</p>
            <p>I had extra time before the assignment was due and chose to teach myself additional design skills such as how to 
                use gradients, to make the website more visually appealing.</p>

            <h3>

            <p>WDD 330 Final Project.</p>
            <p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Google Books API.</p>
            <p>API choice and all website functionality chosen by me. This assignment required use of an API to make a useable 
                app for a customer and had to be completed in 2 weeks.</p>
