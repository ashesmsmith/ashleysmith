            <h3>Hello World!</h3>
            <p>I am a student studying Software Development, looking for opportunities to gain real 
                world experience in the field. I am a fast learner and excellent at “figuring it out”. 
                I work well alone and with a team.</p>

            <h3>Websites</h3>

            <h4>
                <a href="https://ashesmsmith.github.io/wdd130/type1journey/" target="_blank">Type 1 Journey</a>
            </h4>
            <p>WDD 130 Final Project</p>
            <p>Basic use of HTML and CSS. This was my first solo website.</p>

            <h4>
                <a href="https://ashesmsmith.github.io/wdd230/chamber/" target="_blank">Rexburg Chamber of Commerce</a>
            </h4>
            <p>WDD 230 Chamber Project</p>
            <p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript and OpenWeather API.</p>
            <p>Project had to be based on a real city, use an API to display weather data, links had to be functional, and 
                all pages had to be responsive.</p>

            <h4>
                <a href="https://ashesmsmith.github.io/wdd230/final/index.html" target="_blank">Scoots - Original</a>
            </h4>
            <p>WDD 230 Final Project - Original Version</p>
            <p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript and OpenWeather API.</p>
            <p>Information for company name, location, pricing, and rental agreement provided in assignment. I made the logo and 
                favicon, chose the colors, stock images, and made all other design choices.</p>

            <h4>
                <a href="https://ashesmsmith.github.io/wdd230/final-scoots/index.html" target="_blank">Scoots - Final</a>
            </h4>
            <p>WDD 230 Final Project - Final Version</p>
            <p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript and OpenWeather API.</p>
            <p>I had extra time before the assignment was due and chose to teach myself additional design skills such as how to 
                use gradients, to make the website more visually appealing.</p>

            <h4>
                <a href="https://ashesmsmith.github.io/Final/index.html" target="_blank">Bookshelf</a>
            </h4>
            <p>WDD 330 Final Project</p>
            <p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Google Books API.</p>
            <p>API choice and all website functionality chosen by me. This assignment required use of an API to make a useable 
                app for a customer and had to be completed in 2 weeks.</p>
